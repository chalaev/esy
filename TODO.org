1. Add support for the  (unsupported for now) "maxAge" configuration setting.
2. Add support for the  (unsupported for now) "maxDirRecursion" configuration setting.
3. configuration settings: specify logical operation inside hashes, e.g. {logOp="and", name="*.pdf", group="literature"}
4. test if the program can handle dangling links (removed BTW with symlinks -rdv ~)
5. link creation which is not monitored for now.
6. Provide mechanism to stop monitoring directory where too many changes are made.
7. May be I could avoid monitoring all of my 3636 directories; some of them remain unchanged for years...
8. suppose the file has been moved (or chmoded) several times and then received its original name (group) back; then it should be excluded from the list of
   monitored files
9. Perhaps "memory save" mode should be introduced where file change (tracable by rsync and find) is not monitored.
