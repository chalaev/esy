1. example.conf: provide age restriction in hashes, e.g. importantFiles:("*.txt", ... , {group="keepTwoYears", maxage="2y"});
2. test if the program can handle dangling links (removed BTW with symlinks -rdv ~)
3. Move events handling into separate thread?
4. The program must print an extended log similarly to how yandex-disk does it.
   Perhaps low speed (2 files per second, same as for yandex-disk) would be the appropriate.
5. Provide mechanism to stop monitoring directory where too many changes are made.
6. Create separate archives: important-files.tbz and not-junk-files.tbz
7. Upgrade to parse (and act on) novel config. parameters, e.g.,  archiveName + hosts, see example.conf
