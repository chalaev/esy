1. example.conf: provide age restriction in hashes, e.g. importantFiles:("*.txt", ... , {group="keepTwoYears", maxAge="2y"});
2. test if the program can handle dangling links (removed BTW with symlinks -rdv ~)
3. Link creation whic is not monitored for now.
5. Provide mechanism to stop monitoring directory where too many changes are made.
7. Upgrade to parse (and act on) novel config. parameters, e.g.,  archiveName + hosts, see example.conf
