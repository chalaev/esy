1. test if the program can handle dangling links (removed BTW with symlinks -rdv ~)
2. Move events handling into separate thread?
3. The program must print an extended log similarly to how yandex-disk does it.
   Perhaps low speed (2 files per second, same as for yandex-disk) would be the appropriate.
4. Provide mechanism to stop monitoring directory where too many changes are made.
5. Create separate archives: important-files.tbz and not-junk-files.tbz
6. Upgrade to parse (and act on) novel config. parameters, e.g.,  archiveName + hosts, see example.conf
