I use osicat:walk-directory to recursively scan directories.
However, in the current (2016-08-16) osicat release
this function can fail even if there is a single
non-readable file somewhere in the subdirectory free.
(For example, a soft link to a non-existent file.)

The patch-file in this directory fixes the problem.
To apply:
cd ~/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/osicat-20160421-git/src/
patch -p1 < /path-to/call-with-directory-iterator.diff
